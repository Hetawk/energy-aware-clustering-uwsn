## Method 1: SSH Tunneling (Port Forwarding)

### Step 1: Configure SSH on Your Local Machine (Mac)

1. **Open Terminal:** Launch the Terminal application on your Mac.
2. **Create an SSH Tunnel:** Run the following command to forward local port **2299** to port `22` on the lab server:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 2299:192.168.252.237:22 enoch@192.168.252.237
   ```
   - `-L 2299:192.168.252.237:22`: Forwards traffic from local port **2299** to port `22` on the server.
   - `enoch@192.168.252.237`: Specifies your username and the server’s IP address.
3. **Enter Your Password:** Provide your server password when prompted.
4. **Keep the Terminal Open:** The SSH tunnel remains active as long as this Terminal session is running.

### Step 2: Connect via the Tunnel

1. **Open a New Terminal Window:** Leave the tunnel session running.
2. **Connect Using the Tunnel:** Use this command to connect to the server through the forwarded port:
   ```bash
   ssh -p 2299 enoch@localhost
   ```
   - `-p 2299`: Specifies that the connection is made through local port **2299**.
3. **Enter Your Password:** Enter your server password when prompted.

## Method 2: SSH Configuration File (`~/.ssh/config`)

This method simplifies connecting by storing server details in a configuration file.

### Step 1: Create or Edit the SSH Config File

1. **Open Terminal:** Launch Terminal on your Mac.
2. **Check for an Existing Config File:**
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh/config
   ```
   If it doesn’t exist, you’ll see an error message.
3. **Edit the File with Vim:**
   ```bash
   vim ~/.ssh/config
   ```
4. **Add the Following Configuration:**
   ```
   Host ci2pserver
       HostName 192.168.252.237
       User enoch
       Port 22
       LocalForward 2299 192.168.252.237:22
   ```
   - `Host ci2pserver`: The nickname for your lab server.
   - `HostName 192.168.252.237`: The actual IP address.
   - `User enoch`: Your username on the server.
   - `LocalForward 2299 192.168.252.237:22`: Forwards local port **2299** to port `22` on the server.
5. **Save and Exit:** In Vim, press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and press `Enter`.

### Step 2: Connect to the Server

You now have two options:

- **Using Port Forwarding Manually:**
  ```bash
  ssh -p 2299 enoch@localhost
  ```
- **Using the Configured Hostname:**
  ```bash
  ssh ci2pserver
  ```
  Enter your server password when prompted.

### Step 1: Set Up the SSH Server on Your Mac

1. **Enable Remote Login:**  
   Open **System Preferences → Sharing** and enable **Remote Login**. Ensure your user account is permitted.
2. **Determine Your Local IP Address:**  
   Find your Mac’s local IP (e.g., via **System Preferences → Network**; assume it’s `192.168.43.100`).

### Step 2: Create the Reverse Tunnel from the Server

1. **Connect to the Lab Server:** SSH into your lab server from a network that can reach it.
2. **Create the Reverse Tunnel:** On the server, run:
   ```bash
   ssh -R 2299:localhost:22 enoch@192.168.43.100
   ```
   - `-R 2299:localhost:22`: Forwards port **2299** on the server to port `22` on your Mac.
   - Replace `192.168.43.100` with your Mac’s actual IP address.
3. **Enter Your Mac's Password:** When prompted, provide your Mac’s user password.

### Step 3: Connect via the Reverse Tunnel

On the server, run:

```bash
ssh -p 2299 enoch@localhost
```

Enter your server password when prompted.

## Important Considerations

- **Security:** Always use strong passwords or, preferably, SSH key-based authentication.
- **Firewall:** Ensure that the lab server’s firewall allows SSH connections or is properly configured.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** If the lab server is behind a NAT router, set up port forwarding (e.g., forward port `22` or your chosen SSH port).
- **Dynamic IP Address:** If your home or hotspot IP changes frequently, update your firewall rules or use a dynamic DNS service.
- **Data Transfer:** For large file transfers, consider using `scp` or `rsync` over SSH.
- **Session Management:** Use tools like `screen` or `tmux` on the server to preserve sessions during disconnections.
